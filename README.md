“Rokue-Like” is an adventurous and dynamic dungeon exploration game similar to the genre of rogue-like games, where players take on the role of a hero tasked with locating powerful runes scattered across four challenging halls—Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. The hero must overcome various monsters, like archers, fighters, and wizards to go through all elemental halls to succeed. The hero must use their wits, timing, and enchantments to avoid these threats and uncover the runes before time or their lives run out. With the ability to customize the halls they will face with a variety of items, strategic gameplay, and immersive designs, Rokue-Like provides an exciting, challenging experience that tests players' problem-solving and survival instincts.
